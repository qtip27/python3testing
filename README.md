Hi, my name is Donald Hunter, and I am a 20-year veteran of the United States Army. I specialized in vehicle maintenance and troubleshooting electrical systems in the United States Army. I also developed technical and leadership skills from various responsibilities while completing the Warrior Leadership course. 

Since my transition out of the service, I have gained a newfound interest in cybersecurity. Recently, I started my journey into learning more by enrolling at Evolved Security’s Academy, and Codeup. While enrolled, I have gained new skills both technical and professional that I am confident will transition well into this industry. 

Now, I am a Cloud Security Engineer with Thales with an AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner Certification. I’ve always felt that sharing knowledge is important and as I have learned new cybersecurity and cloud skills, I created a blog to share my newfound knowledge.
